# simple-art-display
A simple system to use any screen as an art display, like the samsung glass
The purpose is to allow you to use any display you desire to display art from public respositories (e.g The Metropolitan), with full choice as to how you choose to display it



> Currently only the metropolitan is supported and its still in the early (and very bare bones) stage 
## Roadmap
* Clock, Weather and More pleasing art metadata infomation (toggleable)
* Support for other repositories from other museums and custom repositories
* Support for saving to local storage (for offline option)
* Option to use local files as image source
* GUI
* Remote LAN control
